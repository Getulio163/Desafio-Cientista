# Desafio-Bix
Desafio técnico para Cientista de Dados Bix Technology

1.	What steps would you take to solve this problem? Please describe as completely and clearly as possible all the steps that you see as essential for solving the problem.
Usando metodologia CRISP-DM, fiz um estudo minucioso para tentar solucionar os problemas, os passos são descritos com detalhes no arquivo main.ipynb.
De forma geral a metodologia CRISP-DM aborda 5 passos essenciais.
* Entendimento do negócio
* Entendimento dos dados
* Preparação dos dados
* Modelagem
* Avaliação
* Implementação (deployment)

3.	Which business metric  would you use to solve the challenge?
4.	How do technical metrics relate to the business metrics?
5.	What types of analyzes would you like to perform on the customer database?
6.	What techniques would you use to reduce the dimensionality of the problem? 
7.	What techniques would you use to select variables for your predictive model?
8.	What predictive models would you use or test for this problem? Please indicate at least 3.
9.	How would you rate which of the trained models is the best?
10.	How would you explain the result of your model? Is it possible to know which variables are most important?
11.	How would you assess the financial impact of the proposed model?
12.	What techniques would you use to perform the hyperparameter optimization of the chosen model?
